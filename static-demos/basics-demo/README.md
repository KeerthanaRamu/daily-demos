# Daily basics demo

This demo highlights [Daily's prebuilt UI](https://www.daily.co/blog/prebuilt-ui/), how it can be quickly used to embed a video chat widget, and how a separate menu bar for call participants to control their camera, recording, and screensharing could be built around it. The app calls [Daily API methods](https://docs.daily.co/reference#instance-methods) and listens for [Daily events](https://docs.daily.co/reference#events) to enable the menu bar's button controls.

## Prerequisites

- [Sign up for a Daily account](https://dashboard.daily.co/signup) to swap the placeholder room URLs for your own.

## How the demo works

A participant clicks a "create a room" button, triggering a helper function that generates a temporary demo room. Once the room is created, the participant can click a new button "join meeting (as owner)". This button calls the Daily API [`.join` method](https://docs.daily.co/reference#%EF%B8%8F-join), letting the participant into the call. Once the participant has joined the call, the other buttons around the interface trigger their corresponding Daily methods, so the user can leave the meeting, toggle their camera, or start a recording or screenshare. The app listens for [Daily events](https://docs.daily.co/reference#events) in order to turn on the menu bar buttons.
