# Daily fullscreen prebuilt UI demo
This demo highlights [Daily's prebuilt UI](https://www.daily.co/blog/prebuilt-ui/), and how it can be expanded fullscreen in a website or app.

## Prerequisites 
* [Sign up for a Daily account](https://dashboard.daily.co/signup) to swap the placeholder room URLs for your own. 

## How the demo works 
A participant clicks a "Click here to start a call" button, triggering a function that generates a temporary demo room URL and creates a DailyIframe. The [`iframeStyle` properties](https://docs.daily.co/reference#properties) passed when the DailyIframe is created set the prebuilt UI to fullscreen. 

## Running locally 
1. `cd daily-demos`
2. `cd static-demos`
3. `npm run start` or `npm run dev`
4. Then open your browser and go to `localhost:<port>/static-demos/fullscreen-prebuilt-ui/fullscreen-prebuilt-ui.html`
