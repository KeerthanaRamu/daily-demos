# Daily browser, bandwidth, and device check demo

This demo checks a participant's browser, bandwidth, and device status. It also lets a participant test their camera and microphone in a temporary Daily call.

## Prerequisites

- [Sign up for a Daily account](https://dashboard.daily.co/signup)

## How the demo works

The app calls the [Daily API `supportedBrowser()` method](https://docs.daily.co/reference#-supportedbrowser) and displays a message about the participant's browser accordingly. A participant can then click "continue...test your camera and mic." That generates a test call and runs several tests to confirm the participant's bandwidth and call quality. Once the tests run, the app displays the results to the participant.

## Running locally

1. `cd daily-demos`
2. `cd static-demos`
3. `npm run start` or `npm run dev`
4. Then open your browser and go to `localhost:<port>/static-demos/browser-device-check-demo/browser-device-check-demo.html`
