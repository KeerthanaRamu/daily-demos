# Daily simple chat demo

This demo makes use of the `sendAppMessage()` instance method and the corresponding `app-message` event listener to add a chat interface to a Daily video call.

## How the demo works

When a participant types a message and clicks send, a function fires that adds that message to the participant's local display. The function also broadcasts a message to the other participants using Daily's [`sendAppMessage()`](https://docs.daily.co/reference#%EF%B8%8F-sendappmessage) instance method. `sendAppMessage` triggers the `app-message`event. A callback function on `app-message` updates the other participants' displays and changes the text of "Chat" in their menu bar to red.

## What's next

In this demo, chats do not persist. New callers who join a call are not able to see chat history. For more advanced chat features like this, stay tuned for tutorials on integrating Daily with third-party chat API's.
