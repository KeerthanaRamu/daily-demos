# Daily simple demo

This demo highlights [Daily's prebuilt UI](https://www.daily.co/blog/prebuilt-ui/), and the Daily call events that can be monitored in the console.

## Prerequisites

- [Sign up for a Daily account](https://dashboard.daily.co/signup) to swap the placeholder room URLs for your own.

## How the demo works

A participant clicks a "Click here to start a call" button, triggering a function that generates a temporary demo room URL and creates a DailyIframe. The DailyIframe appears in its default position: the lower right corner. A participant can also monitor [Daily events](https://docs.daily.co/reference#events) on the call by opening up the console.

## Running locally

1. `cd daily-demos`
2. `cd static-demos`
3. `npm run start` or `npm run dev`
4. Then open your browser and go to `localhost:<port>/static-demos/simple-demo/simple.html`
